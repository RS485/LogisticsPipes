# Building Logistics Pipes

If you are familiar with Minecraft Forge and Gradle or you are a Java developer
you should not have many problems starting with Logistics Pipes and your IDE.
But we have some required steps that you need to follow to make things work.


## Prerequisites

1. Having [git](http://git-scm.com/) and git-lfs installed
2. Having an IDE (we do use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))
3. Having [Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/) installed with your IDE (in
IntelliJ IDEA there is a plugin for Lombok which requires annotation processing
to be enabled)
4. Having Java JDK 8, newer versions are not supported.
5. [Discord](https://discord.gg/6vPP3A8) wouldn't be bad if you want to communicate with other
   contributors and us.


## Matrix

[Dev Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#logisticspipes+dev:rs485.network)

[LP Community](https://matrix.to/#/+logisticspipes:rs485.network)

The channels are all linked to Discord and some even to IRC.


## How to set up a local development environment

### git

First off you need to clone Logistics Pipes from GitHub of course. If you only
want to browse the source, you can clone the official repository. But it is best
practice to actually fork the repository and clone your own copy.

The git command line is `git clone https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes.git`
where you can replace *RS485* by your own user name, **if** you forked the
repository.


### git-lfs

If you didn't have git-lfs installed at the time of cloning the git repository,
jar files are "broken", because lfs did not download and replace them.
You can manually run the following commands to fix the situation peacefully:

```shell
$ git lfs install
$ git lfs fetch
$ git lfs checkout
```


### Gradle

After cloning, you can build LP with `./gradlew build` and find the output in
`build/libs`. If the task fails there may be something wrong with maven
repositories or [a Java update broke ForgeGradle 2](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/issues/652)
or something may be wrong with your setup. You may definitely ask for help on
the mentioned communication channels above, but please be sure to state your
issue as good as possible and be nice to others.

### IDEA Quirks

If you opened the project in IDEA before running the `./gradlew build` command the run
configurations will not be visible, simple fix is to reload the project.

If the run configurations are not present still, run `genIntellijRuns` task using IDEA's
Gradle integration, then the configurations will appear.

### Running Minecraft from your dev environment

After you successfully built LP you can probably run Minecraft directly from
your IDE. There may be a ton of missing texture errors and missing language
files though and this problem even happens when using a new clean mod template,
but don't be sad! The solution is to copy your `build/resources/main/*` into
`build/classes/java/main` before launching the game, or you may link those two
 together (Linux or WSL):

```shell
$ rm -r build/resources/main && ln -s ../classes/java/main build/resources/main
```

Windows `cmd`:

```
rd /s /q "build\\resources\\main" && mklink /D "build\\resources\\main" "..\\classes\\java\\main"
```
